# A-Star-Angular
Small project incorporating the A* pathfinding algorithm into an angularjs UI (with angular material components). 

The project was originally an interview assignment task that I continued developing. 

The task was assigned without proposing an algorithm. I elected to use the A-star or A* over breadth-first-search (BFS) because there is a heuristic of direction that makes it more efficient.
